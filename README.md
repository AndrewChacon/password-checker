# Password Strength Checker Project

The goal of this project is to learn about what goes into making a strong password to secure a users personal accounts

The length of a password is very important, the longer the password is the harder it becomes to crack it.
What is recommended is that you select a password with a minimum of 8 characters, however 12 or more is stronger.

Character vairety such ass upper and lower case, digits, and special characters adds more complexity to the password, this and length make it more difficult for brute force approaches.
passwords only containing letters are vulnerable to dictonary attacks, using a list of common passwords or words.

Avoid common passwords and pattenrs, hackers often try your password against a list of common passwords. Some examples include "password123" or sequences such as "qwerty.

The goal should be to strike a balance between memorability and complexity. Your personal passwords should be hard to guess but easy enough for the user to remember.

Some good habits I recomend are to avoid reusing the same password for multiple accounts, each account should have a unique password. If your password is compromised and all your accounts share that same password, which is a very common behavior for users, the rest of your accounts are very much at risk.

Lastly, consider a password manager. They are used to generate very complicated but secure passwords for you, securely. This will prevent you from using weak passwords or reusing the same password.
